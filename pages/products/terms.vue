      <strong class="primary--text">1</strong> For Spot FX and Spot Commodities,
      commission stated is per $100,000 of notional amount traded in a USD
      denominated account. If the FX crosses traded do not have a USD base
      currency, or if the account is denominated in a non-USD currency, then
      conversion may apply and/ or the commission will be adjusted pro-rata to
      get the same equivalent commission as for a USD account trading $100,000
      notional. All other CFDs are charged commission on a per lot basis.

      <strong class="primary--text">2</strong> Additional Price Markup is the
