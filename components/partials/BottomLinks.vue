      <p class="caption">
        CFDs and FX are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing
        money rapidly due to leverage. You should consider whether you
        understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high
        risk of losing your money. Professional clients can lose more than they
        deposit. All trading involves risk. You should not speculate with
        capital that you cannot afford to lose. Past performance in Financial
        markets is not a reliable indicator of future results. Please consider
        our Risk Disclosure , Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use before using
        our services. If you are still unsure if investing is right for you,
        please seek independent advice. HOB assumes no liability for any loss
